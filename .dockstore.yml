# An array of workflows. Each element corresponds to a workflow on Dockstore.
workflows:

# The optional workflow name for a workflow, which may only consist of alphanumerics
  # and internal underscores and hyphens, but no spaces or other characters. Names may not exceed 256 characters.
  # If using a .dockstore.yml with multiple workflows, this field is required
  # to uniquely identify workflows in the repository.
  #
  # It should be noted that having the name come first is an arbitrary decision.
  # You could use subclass instead, for instance. Provided arrays are not broken
  # up, the order of fields within a .dockstore.yml is not important.
  - name: WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample
  # The descriptor language used for the workflow. CWL, WDL, NFL (Nextflow), or GALAXY.
  # This cannot be changed once the workflow is registered.
